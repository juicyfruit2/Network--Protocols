1.in simple terms, a protocol refers to a set of rules or guidelines that govern the communication and interaction between different systems.

2.HTTP is built on top of the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol stack. TCP/IP is a fundamental protocol suite that provides the foundation for communication on the internet. It consists of two main protocols: TCP, which handles the reliable transmission of data, and IP, which deals with the routing and addressing of data packets.

3.If a request is successful, the status code of the response will be 200. The HTTP status code 200 is the standard code used to indicate a successful request. It signifies that the server has processed the request and successfully returned the requested resource or information.

4.A stateless protocol is a type of communication protocol in which each individual request-response interaction is independent and does not depend on any previous interactions or stored state information on the server. In other words, the server treats each request it receives as a standalone transaction without any knowledge of prior requests.
